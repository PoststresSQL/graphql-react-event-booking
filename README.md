# GraphQL React Event Booking App

This is a web app that will introduce me to the world of GraphQL. I'll be using Express and GraphQL as the backend for more precise querying compared to the traditional RESTful API. React will be the front end to display the data.

So Far, to get started you can run:

- Clone the Repository
- `$ npm i` to install dependencies
- `$ npm start` to run the start script which uses nodemon to start the express server
